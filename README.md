Maven
=====

Temporary Maven repository, until I add my artifacts to Maven Central ...

Most things here should be Apache licensed, but please check the individual projects.

Maven Instruction :

* This script expects the following projects pulled from Github in a single parent folder (all the projects should be at same level):

	* /skunkiferous/Maven.
	* /skunkiferous/Common.
	* /skunkiferous/PrimitiveFunc.


* Run the following command to build any one of these project.

``` 	
	mvn -DaltDeploymentRepository=internal::default::file://<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_MAVEN_PROJECT_FOLDER> ^
	deploy -pl ../Base40 -am deploy
```

*Note:*  	
 * This command is being executed from 'Maven' project directory.
 * Switch '-am' ('also make') also builds the other projects that this project is dependent on.
 * remove '-pl ../Base40 -am deploy' part to build all the projects.

* Verify and commit the artifacts in github.

* IMPORTANT : Increment the versions of all the projects that were deployed and pushed to github so that the future release artifacts do not overwrite them.

* To include these artifacts as dependencies use following repository entry in your pom.xml.

```xml
	<repositories>
